# Titanic_Kaggle_Competition
Hey All Data Science Enthuastihs!! Today I have come up with the titanic dataset which is higly recommanded for each and every data science aspiratent. In this we get 2 datasets
Train and test datasets and we furthur process this data to predict the Surivial of the passengers of the titantic ship at 1917. I took the task of prediction by starting with data preprocessing by cleaning the
given dataset and then fitting into Some classification models to check the accuracy. I used Logistic model, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting Classifier and XGB Classifier.
This dataset is a must for the beginners who are trying out the data science feild and wanted to explore the feild as I do. I have referred some of the methods form kaggle for better accuracy
