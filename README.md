# Titanic_Kaggle_Competition
Hey, All Data Science Enthuastihs!! Today, I have come up with the Titanic dataset, which is recommended for every data science aspirant. In this, we have two datasets, Train and test datasets. I further process this data to predict the survival of the passengers of the Titanic ship in 1917. I took the prediction by starting with data preprocessing by cleaning the
given dataset and then fitting it into Some classification models to check the accuracy. I used the Logistic model, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and XGB Classifier.
This dataset is a must for beginners, trying out the data science field and want to explore this domain as I do. I have referred to some of the methods from Kaggle for better accuracy. For the detailed analysis, I will post an article on achieving higher prediction scores on my medium page.
